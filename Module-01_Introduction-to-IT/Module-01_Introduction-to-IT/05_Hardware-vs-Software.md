# Hardware vs. Software

Understanding the distinction between hardware and software is crucial in IT.

## Hardware:
- **Definition:** The physical components of a computer system.
- **Examples:** CPU, RAM, hard drives, motherboard, peripherals.

## Software:
- **Definition:** The set of instructions that tell hardware what to do.
- **Examples:** Operating systems, applications, drivers.

## Interaction:
Software runs on hardware to perform tasks. For instance, a word processor (software) uses the CPU and RAM (hardware) to function.

## Importance:
- **Maintenance:** Hardware may require physical repairs; software may need updates or patches.
- **Compatibility:** Software must be compatible with hardware specifications.
