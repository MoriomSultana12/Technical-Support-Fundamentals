🌟 What Is Binary?
Binary is the language of computers.

It uses only two digits: 0 and 1.

These digits are called bits (short for binary digits).

🧠 Why Binary?
Computers use electricity, which has two states:

ON → 1

OFF → 0

So binary is a perfect fit for electronic devices.


🧮 Bits and Bytes
1 bit = a single 0 or 1

8 bits = 1 byte

A byte can represent 256 different values (from 0 to 255)


🗃️ Binary Number System
Binary is base-2, unlike the decimal system which is base-10.

Example of binary to decimal:

Binary: 00000001 = Decimal: 1

Binary: 00000010 = Decimal: 2

Binary: 00000100 = Decimal: 4
