# Logic Gates

Logic gates process binary inputs to produce an output based on logical rules.

###  Common Gates

| Gate | Rule |
|------|------|
| NOT  | Inverts input (1 ➝ 0, 0 ➝ 1) |
| AND  | 1 if both inputs are 1 |
| OR   | 1 if at least one input is 1 |
| XOR  | 1 if inputs are different |
| NAND | NOT + AND |
| XNOR | NOT + XOR |

🧩 Gates can be connected to build circuits.
