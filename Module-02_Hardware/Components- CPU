🧠 CPU (Central Processing Unit)
📌 Overview
The Central Processing Unit (CPU), often termed the "brain" of the computer, is responsible for executing instructions and processing data. 
It performs calculations and operations that drive the functionality of the computer.​



## 🔍 Key Functions of the CPU
Fetch: Retrieves instructions from memory.
Decode: Interprets the fetched instructions to determine required actions.
Execute: Carries out the instructions using relevant components.​


⚙️ Components of the CPU
Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
Control Unit (CU): Directs operations within the CPU by interpreting instructions and initiating appropriate actions.
Registers: Small storage locations within the CPU that hold data temporarily for quick access.​



🚀 Performance Factors
Clock Speed: Measured in GHz, indicating how many cycles per second the CPU can perform.
Cores: Modern CPUs have multiple cores, allowing them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
Cache Memory: Small-sized, high-speed memory within the CPU that stores frequently accessed data to speed up processes.​



🧩 CPU and System Interaction
The CPU communicates with other components via buses:​

Data Bus: Transfers actual data.
Address Bus: Carries information about where data should reside in memory.
Control Bus: Transmits control signals to coordinate operations.​
