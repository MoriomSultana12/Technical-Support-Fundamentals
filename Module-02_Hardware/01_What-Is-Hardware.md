🖥️ Module 2: Introduction to Computer Hardware
## 📌 Overview:
Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system.
It includes devices like the motherboard, CPU, RAM, hard drives, etc.

## 🔑 Key Points:
Hardware is tangible and essential for the computer's operation.

It is different from software, which is intangible and instructs hardware on what tasks to perform.

## 🧩 Key Hardware Components
🔹 Motherboard
The main circuit board that houses the CPU, memory, and other essential components.
It facilitates communication between all parts of the computer.

🔹 Central Processing Unit (CPU)
Often referred to as the "brain" of the computer" — it performs calculations and executes instructions to carry out tasks.

🔹 Random Access Memory (RAM)
A type of temporary storage that holds data and instructions the CPU needs while performing tasks.
It allows for quick access and fast processing.

## 🔌 What Are Ports?
Ports are physical interfaces on a computer that allow external devices (peripherals) to be connected.
They enable communication between the computer and components such as:

Monitors

Keyboards

USB drives

Network devices

## 🔄 What is the External Data Bus (EDB)?
The External Data Bus (EDB) is a set of wires used to transfer data into and out of the CPU.

** ⚙️ How Does It Work?
The EDB is bidirectional, allowing data to flow both to and from the CPU.

It connects the CPU to:

RAM

Hard Drives or SSDs

Input/Output Ports

** 📏 Bus Width Example:
An 8-bit bus transfers 8 bits of data at a time.

A 64-bit bus moves 64 bits of data at once.

Wider buses = Faster data transfers

## 🧠 What is the Memory Controller Chip (MCC)?
The Memory Controller Chip (MCC) is a vital component of the motherboard.
It manages the flow of data between the CPU and RAM — acting as a traffic controller.

## 🎯 Main Functions of the MCC:
Locates data in RAM requested by the CPU

Transfers data back and forth between the CPU and RAM

Ensures correct and efficient read/write operations

## 💡 Why is the MCC Important?
Without the MCC, the CPU wouldn’t know where to find data in RAM.
(RAM holds millions or billions of data points — CPU relies on MCC to locate and retrieve them.)

Improves system speed and efficiency

Enables multiple RAM modules to work together properly.


## 🧠 What is Cache?
Cache memory is a small, high-speed memory located close to the CPU (sometimes built directly into it).
It stores frequently accessed data and instructions to speed up the CPU’s processing.

## 🔁 Why Is Cache Important?
RAM is fast, but not fast enough for the CPU's speed.

Without cache, the CPU would waste time waiting for data from RAM.

Cache acts as a middle layer between the CPU and RAM, delivering faster access to critical data.

## 📚 How Cache Works:
When the CPU needs data:

It first checks the cache.

If data is found in cache → it’s called a cache hit (✅ fast).

If data is not found → it’s a cache miss (❌ slower; data is then fetched from RAM and stored in cache for next time).

This process minimizes delays and makes the system more responsive.

## 🧱 Levels of Cache:
🔹 L1 Cache (Level 1):
Smallest and fastest

Located inside the CPU

Stores very frequently used instructions

🔹 L2 Cache (Level 2):
Larger than L1, but a bit slower

Can be inside or outside the CPU core

🔹 L3 Cache (Level 3):
Shared between CPU cores

Larger and slower than L2, but still faster than RAM

## 💾 Storage Devices:
🔹 Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)
Use magnetic storage to store data persistently.
➡️ Think of it as the computer’s long-term memory.

🔹 Solid State Drives (SSDs)
Use flash memory and offer faster data access compared to HDDs.
➡️ More reliable and quicker for boot and file access.

⚡ Power Supply Unit (PSU)
Converts electricity from the outlet into usable power for internal components of the computer.

🌬️ Cooling Systems
Fans and heat sinks help dissipate heat generated by hardware components, ensuring safe operating temperatures.
