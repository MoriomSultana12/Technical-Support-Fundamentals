🧠 Simple Notes: BIOS, Drivers & Boot Process
🔌 How Devices Talk to CPU
Devices (keyboard, mouse) use drivers — special programs that help the CPU understand them.
Without drivers, the CPU can’t use external devices.


🖥️ What is BIOS?
BIOS = Basic Input/Output System
Starts the hardware and loads the operating system.
Stored in ROM (not erased when power is off).



🌐 UEFI ( Unified Extensible Firmware Interface )
Modern version of BIOS.
Faster, supports newer hardware.
Most new computers use UEFI.


🔁 POST (Power-On Self Test)
Quick test when computer starts to check hardware.
Beep codes tell if something's wrong:

1 beep = OK
2+ beeps = Problem
Beep codes differ by computer brand.


⚙️ BIOS/CMOS Settings
CMOS chip stores settings like time, date, and boot order.
Access BIOS/CMOS during startup (press F2, Del, etc.).
You can change which device to boot from (USB, CD, etc.).


💻 Reimaging a Computer

Reimaging = Erase everything & reinstall OS.
Usually done from USB, CD, or network.
Change boot settings in BIOS to start from that device.
