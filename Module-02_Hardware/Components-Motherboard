🧠 Motherboard : 
The motherboard is the main circuit board of a computer. 
It connects and communicates with all the internal and external components, 
powering and controlling the overall functionality of the system.

🛠️ Key Functions
Connects all components: CPU, RAM, storage, GPU, I/O devices, etc.
Routes power: Distributes power from the Power Supply Unit (PSU).
Facilitates communication: Between hardware components.
Supports expansion: Allows upgrading through expansion slots.


🧩 Important Components

🔘 Chipset
Controls communication between CPU, RAM, storage, and peripherals.
Comprised of two main parts:
Northbridge: Connects high-speed components (RAM, video cards).
Southbridge: Manages I/O devices (hard drives, USB, etc).

🔄 Note: In modern systems, the Northbridge is integrated into the CPU.



⌨️ Peripherals
External devices like keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc.
Communicate with CPU via the chipset.


🧱 Expansion Slots
Allow users to upgrade hardware, like adding a new GPU or sound card.

The standard interface is:
PCI Express (PCIe): High-speed slot for expansion cards.
Expansion cards are small circuit boards that fit into PCIe slots.

📏 Form Factor
Refers to the physical size and shape of the motherboard.

Determines:
What case and components are compatible.
Number and type of expansion slots available.

🔹 Common Types:
ATX (Advanced Technology Extended) – Standard size for desktops.
Mini ITX, Nano ITX, Pico ITX – Smaller variations for compact builds.
Intel NUC – Uses very compact ITX variations.

🧠 Why It Matters
Understanding motherboard components helps with:
Diagnosing hardware issues.
Ensuring compatibility when replacing or upgrading parts.
Selecting the right RAM, CPU socket, or graphics card.

🧪 Real-world Example
If a user is having video issues and you replace their graphics card, make sure the new card fits the motherboard and is compatible with the expansion slot and form factor.
