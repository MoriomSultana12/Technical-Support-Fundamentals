### 🖥️ Random Access Memory (RAM)
📌 Overview
Random Access Memory (RAM) is a type of computer memory that temporarily stores data and machine code currently being used. 
It allows for quick read and write access to a storage medium that is faster than other types of storage 
like hard drives or SSDs.


### 🔑 Key Characteristics of RAM
Volatile Memory: RAM loses its data when the computer is turned off.

Temporary Storage: Holds data that the CPU needs quick access to while performing tasks.

Speed: Significantly faster than permanent storage devices, facilitating efficient data retrieval and processing.


### 🛠️ Role in System Performance
Multitasking: Adequate RAM enables smooth operation of multiple applications simultaneously.

System Responsiveness: More RAM can improve the speed and responsiveness of a system, 
reducing reliance on slower disk-based virtual memory.



### 🧩 Types of RAM
Dynamic RAM (DRAM): Commonly used in personal computers; requires periodic refreshing to maintain data.

Static RAM (SRAM): Faster and more expensive than DRAM; used for cache memory.



### 🔄 RAM vs. Storage
It's important to distinguish between RAM and permanent storage:

RAM: Temporary, fast-access memory used for active tasks.

Storage (HDD/SSD): Permanent storage for files and applications.


### 📈 Upgrading RAM
Increasing the amount of RAM can lead to performance improvements, 
especially in systems that run memory-intensive applications or multitask heavily.
However, there are limits based on the motherboard and operating system capabilities.
