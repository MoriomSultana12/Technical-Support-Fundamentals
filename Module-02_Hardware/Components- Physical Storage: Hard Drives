** ðŸ“¦ DATA STORAGE BASICS ** 

The SMALLEST UNIT of data is a BIT â€” stores a 0 or 1 (binary digit).
BYTE = 8 BITS â€” can store a letter, number, or symbol.
KILOBYTE (KB) = 1,024 BYTES
MEGABYTE (MB) = 1,024 KB
GIGABYTE (GB) = 1,024 MB
TERABYTE (TB) = 1,024 GB

Example:
A 500 GB hard drive can store around 165,000 music files (average file size: 3 MB).

ðŸ’½ STORAGE DEVICES
All computer data is stored on hard drives. These are used for:
Storing programs, files, pictures, music, etc.
Always BACKUP important data to avoid loss from crashes.

ðŸŒ€ HARD DISK DRIVE (HDD)
Uses spinning platters and mechanical arms to read/write data.
Performance depends on RPM (Revolutions Per Minute).
Common RPM: 5,400 or 7,200
CHEAPER but has MOVING PARTS, so itâ€™s more prone to damage.


âš¡ SOLID STATE DRIVE (SSD)
Uses microchips â€” NO MOVING PARTS.
Similar to how USB sticks store data.
FASTER, SLIMMER, and LESS FRAGILE than HDDs.
MORE EXPENSIVE, so you usually get less storage for the price.

ðŸ”„ HYBRID DRIVES (SSHD)
Mix of SSD + HDD.
SSD used for system performance , HDD for basic storage.

Balances speed and affordability.

ðŸ”Œ INTERFACES (CONNECTING DRIVES)
ATA (Advanced Technology Attachment) â€” standard interface.
SATA (Serial ATA) â€” common for both HDDs and SSDs:
Hot-swappable: No need to turn off PC to add/remove drives.
Faster and more efficient than older interfaces.

NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express):
Used with newer, high-speed SSDs.
Doesnâ€™t use cables â€” fits into an expansion slot.

Offers higher data speeds and better performance than SATA.

ðŸ§  SUMMARY
BITS â†’ BYTES â†’ KB â†’ MB â†’ GB â†’ TB = units of data.
HDD = CHEAPER, MORE FRAGILE, SLOWER
SSD = FASTER, SAFER, EXPENSIVE
SATA is standard; NVMe is fastest for modern SSDs.
Always BACK UP DATA to avoid losing important files.
